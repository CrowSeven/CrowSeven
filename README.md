- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrowSeven
- 👀 I’m interested in: way, way too many things for only one lifetime. I've been to college four times, four different majors, and would go another round if..., and I've changed "careers" about every five years (working on #8).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I know nothing while absorbing everything I can about many types of code. I read so mcuh that I've been invited to and given secure access
  to multiple training sites - by bot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure yet. Seeking my niche
- 📫 How to reach me ... why would anyone want to do that? You could try my name at the atomic nuclei (Very dad-joke of me)
- 😄 Pronouns: I call myself a bird, but I'm really a silky, long-haired house cat  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm highly entertaining, although I don't mean to be - Things fall off shelves as I walk the aisles in stores. I can't get the lid off the jar, but I can break
  the glass without trying. I forget what I'm doing while I'm doing it, yet remember conversations had, verbatim, from 1986. I trip over everything (and nothing).
